To all those who pass these gates, I bid thee welcome.
======================================================

Pete St. Onge here, aka @peat-monster, wearer of many hats over the years (teacher, trainer, developer, sysadmin, DBA, architect, speaker).

I work mostly in the public sector, principally using open source technologies and processes to the particular needs of the individual customers I support, being sensitive to the financial / technical / operational circumstances in which they operate.

My areas of interest revolve around how technology can help -- supporting, enabling, empowering, and securing -- the person while meeting business needs.
